The LandTiger LPC17XX board features a 2 way CAN bus.
Controller Area Network (CAN) is the definition of a high performance communication 
protocol for serial data communication. The CAN Controller is designed to provide a full 
implementation of the CAN-Protocol according to the CAN Specification Version 2.0B. 
Microcontrollers with this on-chip CAN controller are used to build powerful local networks 
by supporting distributed real-time control with a very high level of security. The 
applications are automotive, industrial environments, and high speed networks as well as 
low cost multiplex wiring. The result is a strongly reduced wiring harness and enhanced 
diagnostic and supervisory capabilities.
In order to enable the can bus on the simulator, under the settings tab, you need to select a 
folder for each CAN you want to enable.
Different instances of keil that you want to connect have to share the same folder.
After selecting the folder, select the color in order to distinguish the connection and than 
set the acceptance filter and don't forget to enable the proper CAN connection.
